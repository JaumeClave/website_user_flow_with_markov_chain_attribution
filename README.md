# Visualizing the Customer Funnel and Using Markov Chains for Website Page Attribution
<p align="justify">Websites collect a vast array of data for many different uses. This includes data you provide via forms, for example, email address and credit card information, as well as many other types of information gained from tracking technology in the form of cookies. Decision makers need to form data-driven approaches to enhance their website framework in order to facilitate user journey and purchasing funnel from entrance to conversion. By investigating click data and website behavior metrics the site may be optimized and user experience and therefore company revenue increased. This project investigates anonymized data from an ecommerce site. It analyzes the data to understand how customers behave and purchase on the site and provides recommendations to management for website restructure. This project uses Markov chains and transition matrices to identify the probabilities of moving from one event (page) to another. It visualizes the user flow through various interactive sankey models that rank and provide information for each step in the conversion funnel. The layout of the website and its pages are presented through a network analytics study in which various graphing algorithms are used to depict the traffic between the directed network.</p>
